Test with RFID-RC522

A list of popular RFID ranges:
•	High Frequency (HF) - 13.56 MHz
•	Ultra High Frequency (UHF) - 868 - 928 MHz
•	Very High Frequency (VHF) - 134 - 174 MHz
•	Low Frequency (LF) - 125 - 134.2 KHz
•	Microwave Frequency (MF) - 2.45 GHz
These are the most commonly used RFID ranges, and the choice of frequency range depends on the specific application and requirements of the RFID system.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) on metal can be challenging due to the metal's ability to reflect and absorb radio waves, which can affect the RFID signal.
However, there are a few frequency ranges that are better suited for reading RFID tags on metal surfaces:
•	Ultra High Frequency (UHF) - UHF tags are better suited for use on metal surfaces as they operate at a higher frequency and have a longer read range compared to other frequencies.
•	Low Frequency (LF) - LF tags also work well on metal, although they have a shorter read range compared to UHF tags.
•	High Frequency (HF) - HF tags can also be used on metal, but the signal can be affected by metal interference and the read range may be reduced.
It is important to choose the appropriate frequency range and tag design for your specific application and requirements, as the choice of frequency range will impact the read range and accuracy of the RFID system when reading tags on metal surfaces.

RFID on metal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID_on_metal)
RFID on metal (abbreviated to ROM) are radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags which perform a specific function when attached to metal objects. The ROM tags overcome some of the problems traditional RFID tags suffer when near metal, such as detuning and reflecting of the RFID signal, which can cause poor tag read range, phantom reads, or no read signal at all.

The RFID-on-metal tags are designed to compensate for the effects of metal. There are several tag design methods to create ROM tags. The original method was to provide a spacer to shield the tag antenna from the metal, creating bigger tags. New techniques focus on specialized antenna design that utilizes the metal interference and signal reflection for longer read range than similar sized tags attached to non-metal objects.[1] RFID-on-metal transponders will continue to create new opportunities for users in a wide range of asset tracking and broader industrial applications. The main applications are asset tracking on servers and laptops in IT data centers, industrial manufacturing quality control and manufacturing, oil and gas pipeline maintenance, and gas cylinders.[2] The technology is evolving to allow transponders to be embedded in metal. The capability allows manufacturers to track small metal items from cradle to grave. The main focus for RFID inside metal is tool tracking, weapon tracking, and medical device quality control.

RuBee (IEEE 1902.1) on metal

RuBee is a wireless 132 kHz packet-based protocol, with range of few feet to 50 feet, is magnetic and has near zero Radio Frequency (E)[3] energy. RuBee is often used when RF based systems have challenges in harsh environments especially on and near steel and metal. Because it is magnetic it has no multipath reflections so no nulls, and is not blocked by steel, water, snow or dirt. RuBee is in widespread use in industrial environments (over 1,500 sites) on heavy machinery (Injection Molding Machines and Tools[4] ), in armories[5] and many defense[6] applications.
